# Slim Framework 3 Php-Di Skeleton

This is a simple Slim 3 skeleton to quickly get started building your Slim 3 applications.
For this application I have chosen a php-di/slim-bridge for dependency injection.

###Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/fritsvt/slim-di-skeleton
```

###Run the project
To run the slim application execute the command below
```
php -S localhost:8000 -t public/
```

I hope to get this on composer soon....
